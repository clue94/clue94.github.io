    <h1>About Chantal Lue</h1>

    <p>Entering my senior year at the University of Miami, I have been able to refine my communication skills with not only courses specific to my public relations major, but experience developed in the field as well. Throughout my undergraduate career I have had the opportunity to intern at PR agencies specializing in fashion, food, and hospitality, as well as becoming involved with fashion enterprises such as ASOS and local Miami boutique, Style Mafia.<p>
    <p>Fashion is an unspoken art form. For me, it has always been an outlet to express my creativity. I come up with different outfits in my head that have been inspired by current trends and my own individual style.  The result is something uniquely mine and as special as giving birth to your own child, which you want to nurture and share with the world. Whether it’s for some "likes" on Instagram or to debut the new spring collection, that outfit essentially serves as an extension of one’s self.</p>
    <p>It is my dream to provide that service to clientele, sharing their art to the world in a strategic way that will benefit their brand and gain additional coverage within their target markets. I am eager to delve into the fashion PR industry and offer my knowledge and expertise to others because for me, success is measured by the positive differences you make in people's lives.</p>
