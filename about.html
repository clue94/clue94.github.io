    <h1>About Chantal Lue</h1>

    <p>Everyone has a voice. We use it to make casual conversations with one another, sing our new favorite song on the radio, or deliver that unwarranted speech in your public speaking class. Our voice is constantly used in our day-to-day routine, yet many people do not understand how powerful it really is. I know the old saying goes, “sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt me,” but au contraire, excuse my French. Words are the driving force behind every emotionally charged delivery. The right word choice can lead a mere citizen of the United States to the White House to attain the most powerful leadership position in the free world.</p>
    <p>Our voice can bring about change. It can shed light upon the perils of this country and inform the masses about any situation. It can lead a group of college educated students down the streets of Ferguson chanting, “black lives matter,” to draw attention from the major media outlets. It can lead a murderer to a jail sentence after the witness’s testimony on the stand led the jury to see the defendant as guilty. The faster we as citizens begin to realize the weapon that is our voice, the faster we can make aware of situations going on in our own communities.</p>
    <p>So what does that have to do with journalism? Everything. You see, I have been made aware about the power of my voice and I want to use that power to contribute my voice to the issues of today. Since my time at the University of Miami, I have sought to sharpen my skills so that not only is my physical voice polished and thoughts well-collected, but that my writer’s voice conveys the same effect. I believe it is a journalist’s duty to deliver the hard-hitting facts about what is going on in the world so that the intended audience becomes informed enough to develop their own opinion regarding the situation. I want to continue advancing my journalistic skills and will diligently work on becoming a well-rounded multimedia journalist reaching a larger audience through various outlets including, video, photography, and social media. I am always eager to learn how to strengthen my weapon so that one day, I can inadvertently make a change to the world.</p>
